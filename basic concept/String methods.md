# String methods

Recap
1. The .toUpperCase() method makes a new copy of a string 
while converting every single character to uppercase.
2. The .toLowerCase() method creates a copy of the string that is all in lower case.
3. Pay attention to the way those methods are called: 
.toUpperCase() with a capital U and capital C. Same for
.toLowerCase() with a capital L and capital C.
4. The () at the end of the method are required.
